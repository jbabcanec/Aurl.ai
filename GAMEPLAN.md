# 🎼 Aurl.ai: State-of-the-Art Music Generation AI - Master Gameplan

## 🚨 CRITICAL ORGANIZATIONAL PRINCIPLES

**STOP & CHECK PROTOCOL**: Before EVERY action:
1. Verify current directory location
2. Confirm file placement follows established structure
3. Run quick validation of recent changes
4. Check that naming conventions are followed
5. Ensure no duplicate functionality exists

**TEST OUTPUTS PROTOCOL**: ALL test outputs MUST be placed in `tests/outputs/` directory structure:
- Test artifacts → `tests/outputs/artifacts/`
- Generated samples → `tests/outputs/samples/`
- Test logs → `tests/outputs/logs/`
- Test representations → `tests/outputs/test_output_representation/`
- NEVER place test outputs in project root directory

**Organization > Speed**: A misplaced file or poorly named function will compound into hours of confusion. Take the extra 30 seconds to place things correctly.

## 📊 Scalability Principles

### Smart Data Management
- **NO** storing millions of preprocessed files
- **YES** to on-the-fly processing with intelligent caching
- **YES** to lazy loading and streaming architectures
- **YES** to hierarchical storage (raw → processed → cached)

### Memory-Efficient Design
- Process data in chunks, never load entire dataset
- Use memory-mapped files for large arrays
- Implement data generators, not static datasets
- Profile memory usage at every stage

### Computational Efficiency
- Batch similar operations
- Use vectorized operations over loops
- Implement early stopping aggressively
- Cache expensive computations intelligently

## 🔄 System Integration Architecture

Before proceeding with Phase 2, here's how the skeleton components will connect to form a cohesive music generation system:

### 🎵 Musical Data Understanding

**Core Musical Elements** (as you noted):
- **Pitch**: Note values (C4, F#3, etc.) → MIDI note numbers (60, 66, etc.)
- **Velocity**: Dynamics/volume (ppp to fff) → MIDI velocity values (1-127)  
- **Rhythm**: Timing/duration → Time-based sequences with precise timing

These three elements form the foundation of our data representation and will be preserved throughout the entire pipeline.

### 🏗️ Component Integration Flow

#### 1. **Entry Points → Core System**
```
train_pipeline.py / generate_pipeline.py
         ↓
    Config System (src/utils/config.py)
         ↓ 
    Logger Setup (src/utils/logger.py)
         ↓
    Constants/Utilities (src/utils/constants.py)
```

#### 2. **Data Flow Architecture**
```
Raw MIDI Files (pitch/velocity/rhythm)
         ↓
    MIDI Parser (src/data/midi_parser.py)
    - Extract: notes, velocities, timing, tempo, key sigs
    - Validate: check for corruption, repair if needed
         ↓
    Preprocessor (src/data/preprocessor.py) 
    - Normalize: velocities, quantize timing
    - Segment: long pieces into training sequences
    - Convert: to model-ready tensor format
         ↓
    Augmentation (src/data/augmentation.py)
    - Transpose: pitch shifting (-12 to +12 semitones)
    - Time stretch: rhythm variations (0.8x to 1.2x)
    - Velocity scale: dynamic variations
         ↓
    Dataset (src/data/dataset.py)
    - PyTorch Dataset: streaming, batching, caching
    - Memory management: intelligent caching system
         ↓
    DataLoader → Training
```

#### 3. **Model Architecture Flow**
```
Tokenized Music Sequences
         ↓
    MusicTransformerVAEGAN (src/models/music_transformer_vae_gan.py)
    ├── Transformer Backbone (attention over music sequences)
    ├── VAE Branch (latent space for style/structure)
    └── GAN Branch (adversarial training for realism)
         ↓
    Generated Music Tokens
         ↓
    Post-processing → MIDI Export
```

#### 4. **Training Pipeline Integration**
```
Trainer (src/training/trainer.py)
├── Loads: Config → Model → Data
├── Orchestrates: Training loop with logging
├── Manages: Checkpoints, early stopping, LR scheduling  
├── Tracks: Loss functions (reconstruction + KL + adversarial)
└── Logs: Progress via logger system
```

#### 5. **Generation Pipeline Integration**
```
Generator (src/generation/generator.py)
├── Loads: Trained model from checkpoint
├── Supports: Multiple sampling strategies
├── Applies: Musical constraints and post-processing
└── Exports: High-quality MIDI files
```

### 🔧 Key Integration Patterns

#### **Configuration-Driven Design**
Every component accepts config objects, allowing:
- Easy experimentation through YAML changes
- Environment-specific optimizations (dev/test/prod)
- CLI overrides without code changes

#### **Logging Throughout**
Every component uses the shared logger:
- Structured progress tracking
- Error reporting and debugging
- Performance monitoring
- Experiment reproducibility

#### **Error Handling Strategy**
- **MIDI Parser**: Fault-tolerant with repair capabilities
- **Preprocessing**: Graceful degradation for edge cases
- **Training**: Automatic checkpoint recovery
- **Generation**: Fallback sampling strategies

#### **Memory Management**
- **Streaming**: Never load full dataset into memory
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching with size limits
- **Batching**: Dynamic batch sizing based on sequence length
- **Cleanup**: Automatic garbage collection between epochs

#### **Scalability Principles**
- **Lazy Loading**: Only process data when needed
- **Chunked Processing**: Handle arbitrarily large datasets
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-worker data loading
- **Distributed**: Ready for multi-GPU scaling

### 🎯 Data Representation Strategy

Our approach preserves the three core musical elements:

1. **Raw MIDI** → **Event Sequence**: `[(pitch, velocity, start_time, duration), ...]`
2. **Event Sequence** → **Tokens**: Vocabulary of musical events + timing
3. **Tokens** → **Model Input**: Padded sequences ready for transformer processing
4. **Model Output** → **Tokens**: Generated token sequences  
5. **Tokens** → **MIDI**: Convert back to pitch/velocity/rhythm for export

This bidirectional conversion ensures we never lose musical meaning while enabling powerful neural generation.

### 🚀 Execution Flow

#### Training Mode:
1. `train_pipeline.py` loads config and initializes components
2. Data pipeline processes MIDI files into model-ready batches
3. Training loop updates model weights using multi-objective loss
4. Logger tracks progress, saves checkpoints, generates samples
5. Studies modules analyze training data to inform model improvements

#### Generation Mode:
1. `generate_pipeline.py` loads trained model and config
2. User specifies generation parameters (style, length, constraints)
3. Model generates token sequences using specified sampling strategy
4. Post-processing applies musical constraints and cleanup
5. Export system converts tokens back to high-quality MIDI files

This architecture ensures that every component is:
- **Testable**: Clear interfaces and separation of concerns
- **Configurable**: Driven by the flexible config system
- **Scalable**: Memory-efficient and parallel-ready
- **Maintainable**: Well-organized with comprehensive logging
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones

- **High temp (2.0)**: More diverse but still repetitive patterns, wrong token order
- **Note pairing score**: 0.0 (no proper NOTE_ON → NOTE_OFF pairs)

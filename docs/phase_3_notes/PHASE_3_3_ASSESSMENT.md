## 🎼 Musical Intelligence Assessment

### Multi-Scale Musical Analysis
The discriminator operates at three musical scales:
- **Local Scale (32 tokens)**: Individual notes, micro-timing, articulation
- **Phrase Scale (128 tokens)**: Musical phrases, chord progressions, local patterns  
- **Global Scale (256 tokens)**: Song structure, long-term coherence, style consistency

### Musical Feature Extraction Quality
1. **Rhythm Analysis**: Detects timing patterns from TIME_SHIFT tokens (256-767)
2. **Harmonic Analysis**: Identifies simultaneous notes for chord detection
3. **Melodic Analysis**: Tracks pitch contours and interval patterns
4. **Dynamics Analysis**: Recognizes velocity patterns from VELOCITY_CHANGE tokens (768-773)

### Perceptual Loss Components
- **Rhythm Consistency**: 0.44 (good timing regularity)
- **Harmonic Coherence**: 0.06 (low harsh interval penalty - good)
- **Melodic Smoothness**: 0.30 (reasonable leap penalty)

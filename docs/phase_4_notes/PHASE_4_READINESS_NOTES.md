## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Excellence for Professional Training

### **1. Flexibility & Extensibility Assessment** üåü **EXCEPTIONAL**

**Configuration-Driven Flexibility**:
```yaml
# Training can scale from research to production seamlessly
training:
  # Research mode
  batch_size: 8
  max_epochs: 50
  early_stopping:
    patience: 10
    min_delta: 0.001
  
  # Production mode  
  batch_size: 256
  max_epochs: 1000
  distributed: true
  mixed_precision: true
  early_stopping:
    patience: 50

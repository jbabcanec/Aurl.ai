## ðŸ“Š Technical Implementation

### **Core Components (4 New Modules)**

#### 1. **Early Stopping System** (`early_stopping.py`)
```python
# Multi-metric early stopping with musical quality
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(EarlyStoppingConfig(
    patience=15,
    primary_metric="combined",
    metric_weights={
        "total_loss": 0.3,
        "reconstruction_loss": 0.3,
        "musical_quality": 0.4
    },
    detect_instability=True,
    enable_recovery=True
))
```

#### 2. **Learning Rate Scheduler** (`lr_scheduler.py`)
```python
# Adaptive LR with musical optimization
scheduler = AdaptiveLRScheduler(optimizer, LRSchedulerConfig(
    warmup_strategy=WarmupStrategy.COSINE,
    decay_strategy=DecayStrategy.COSINE,
    plateau_patience=8,
    musical_warmup=True,
    metric_based_reduction=True
))
```

#### 3. **Regularization System** (`regularization.py`)
```python
# Comprehensive regularization with musical constraints

    gradient_clip_strategy=GradientClipStrategy.ADAPTIVE,
    musical_consistency_reg=True,
    temporal_smoothness_reg=True
))
```

#### 4. **Stochastic Weight Averaging** (`lr_scheduler.py`)
```python
# Model ensembling for better generalization
swa = StochasticWeightAveraging(
    model, 
    swa_start_epoch=10,
    swa_lr=1e-5
)

    )
    
    # Update scheduler with metrics
    scheduler.step(metrics)
    
    # Check early stopping
    es_result = early_stopping.update(metrics, model=model, epoch=epoch)
    
    # Update SWA
    swa.update(epoch=epoch, model=model)
    
    if es_result["should_stop"]:

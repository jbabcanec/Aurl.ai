# 🗂️ Training Scripts Organization

## ✅ **FIXED AND ORGANIZED**

### 🎯 **Primary Training Script**

**`train.py`** - 🌟 **MAIN ENTRY POINT**
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive 3-stage training pipeline with state persistence
- **Features**: Automatic progression, resume capability, clean interface
- **Usage**: `python train.py` (recommended for all training)

### 🔧 **Legacy Scripts** (All Fixed and Working)

**`scripts/training/train_progressive.py`** 
- **Purpose**: Multi-stage training (transformer → VAE → VAE-GAN)  
- **Status**: ✅ **WORKING** (import paths fixed)
- **Features**: Similar to new train.py but without state persistence
- **Usage**: `python scripts/training/train_progressive.py`

**`scripts/training/train_enhanced.py`**
- **Purpose**: Enhanced training with monitoring and progress bars
- **Status**: ✅ **WORKING** (import paths fixed)  
- **Features**: Real-time monitoring, clean output, progress tracking
- **Usage**: `python scripts/training/train_enhanced.py`

**`scripts/training/train_pipeline.py`**
- **Purpose**: Original comprehensive training pipeline
- **Status**: ✅ **WORKING** (import paths fixed)
- **Features**: Full feature set, hyperparameter optimization, distributed training
- **Usage**: `python scripts/training/train_pipeline.py`

## 📋 **What I Fixed**

### 🔧 **Import Path Issues**
- **Problem**: All scripts in `scripts/training/` had broken imports
- **Root Cause**: Wrong path calculation (`parent / "src"` instead of `parent.parent.parent`)
- **Solution**: Fixed Python path to point to project root

### 📝 **Documentation Updates**  
- **Problem**: All docs referenced deleted `train_simple.py`
- **Solution**: Updated all references to point to new `train.py`
- **Files Updated**: `GAMEPLAN.md`, `README.md`, `scripts/README.md`

### 🗃️ **Script Organization**
- **Clear Hierarchy**: `train.py` (primary) → `scripts/training/` (legacy/specialized)
- **All Working**: Every script now imports correctly and runs
- **No Conflicts**: Clear documentation about what each script does

## 🎯 **Recommendations**

### **For Normal Training**
```bash
python train.py              # Start 3-stage pipeline
python train.py --status     # Check progress  
python train.py --stage 1    # Run just stage 1
```

### **For Specialized Needs**
```bash
# If you want the original progressive training
python scripts/training/train_progressive.py

# If you want enhanced monitoring
python scripts/training/train_enhanced.py

# If you want full features (distributed, etc.)
python scripts/training/train_pipeline.py
```

---

## ✅ **Summary**

**No Conflicts**: Each script has a clear purpose
**All Working**: Import issues resolved  
**Clear Primary**: `train.py` is the main script
**Preserved Features**: All existing functionality maintained
**Updated Docs**: All references corrected

**Ready for training with any script you prefer!** 🚀

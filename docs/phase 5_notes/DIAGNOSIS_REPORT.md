# Aurl.ai Music Generation Diagnosis Report

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: "Forced chord progressions" and lack of natural 2-voice piano generation

**Root Cause Identified**: Model collapse during training, NOT constraint system issues

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Architecture ✅ HEALTHY
- 4.6M parameters loaded correctly
- MusicTransformerVAEGAN architecture working
- Logits distribution is reasonable (entropy 5.39)
- No probability concentration issues

### 2. Constraint System ✅ NOT THE PROBLEM
- Constraints can be disabled with `--no-constraints` flag (now added)
- Harmonic constraint logic exists but doesn't cause repetition
- Issue persists even with all constraints disabled

### 3. Training Issue ❌ CORE PROBLEM
**Model Collapse Symptoms:**
- Greedy: Repeats token 139 infinitely
- Low temp (0.5): Repeats token 120 infinitely  
- Medium temp (1.0): Repeats token 52 infinitely
- Top-k/Top-p: Still get repetition
- **Only high temperature (2.0) produces diversity**

### 4. Token Analysis
**Repetitive Generation:**
```
Greedy: [1, 139, 139, 139, 139, 139, ...]
Low temp: [1, 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, ...]
Medium temp: [1, 52, 52, 52, 52, 52, ...]
```

**Diverse Generation (temp=2.0):**
```
High temp: [1, 56, 56, 56, 633, 542, 694, 393, 676, 754, ...]
```

## Solutions

### Immediate Workaround
Use high temperature generation with no constraints:
```bash
python generate.py --checkpoint model.pt --no-constraints \
  --strategy temperature --temperature 2.0 --length 256
```

### Long-term Fixes

#### 1. Retrain the Model
The current model needs retraining with:
- Better training data (actual classical MIDI files)
- More training epochs
- Improved loss function to prevent collapse
- Better learning rate scheduling

#### 2. Training Data Requirements
For natural 2-voice piano:
- Bach Two-Part Inventions
- Mozart Piano Sonatas (melody + accompaniment)
- Chopin Études (simpler ones)
- Debussy Arabesque No. 1

#### 3. Model Training Improvements
- Add sequence-level loss to prevent repetition
- Use label smoothing to prevent overconfidence
- Implement curriculum learning (start with shorter sequences)
- Add diversity penalties during training

## What's Actually Working

### Infrastructure ✅ Production Ready
- Phase 4.6 complete: training, logging, checkpointing
- Generation pipeline functional
- MIDI export system working
- Constraint system properly implemented

### Sampling ✅ Architecture Sound
- Multiple sampling strategies implemented
- Temperature control working
- Constraint system can be disabled

## Recommendations

### For Natural Music Generation NOW:
1. Use temperature 2.0 with no constraints
2. Filter/post-process generated sequences
3. Use multiple samples and cherry-pick best results

### For Production Quality:
1. **Retrain model** with proper classical music dataset
2. Implement sequence-level training objectives
3. Add diversity regularization to prevent collapse

## Technical Details

### Current Model Status:
- Vocab size: 774 tokens
- Architecture: 4-layer transformer, 256 hidden dim
- Training: Appears to have collapsed to common tokens
- Generation speed: ~8-30 tokens/sec (varies by method)

### Token Distribution in Repetitive Output:
- Token 139: NOTE_ON for MIDI note 126 (out of piano range)
- Token 120: NOTE_ON for MIDI note 107 (high piano)
- Token 52: NOTE_ON for MIDI note 39 (low piano)

**The model learned to predict the most frequent tokens from training data but didn't learn sequential musical patterns.**

## Conclusion

The issue is **NOT** forced chord progressions - it's model training quality. The constraint system works fine and can be disabled. The infrastructure is excellent. **You need to retrain the model with better data and training procedures to get natural 2-voice piano music.**
